# CSCI245Project4

Spring 2020, CSCI245 Programming II, Project 4

This project is a text adventure game built entirely from scratch with a team. Building
this was an exercise in not only implementation of design patterns and development strategies,
but also in programming as a team. If you wish to play the game, run PlayGame.java. Please ignore
the whimsical nature of the dialouge in the gameplay, this was a team effort, and notice several
design features, such as layer linked structures, use of various abstract data types, and 
dynamic addition and removal of abilities and movements available to the user.
